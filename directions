My project is implementing mcts, alpha-amaf, and rave for connect4.
To get my detailed analysis of my project, run: make analysis
To run mcts vs mcts, run make mcts-mcts
To run mcts vs rave, run make mcts-rave
To run mcts vs alpha-amaf, run make mcts-amaf
To run customised tests, run make custom
To play against my agent, run make human
To run amaf with a lot of debug output, run make amaf-debug
All of my tests can be customised to some degree, and I explain how to customize each in the comment for that command
